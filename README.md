## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Thomas

I am a self-taught programmer who has been obsessed with programming for the past 5 years. I make software for myself and, occasionally, for friends. Here you can find some of my projects that I worked on, from simple problem solutions to network applications and real-life scenarios!
