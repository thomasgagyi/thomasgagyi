## Hi there üëã I'm Thomas

I am a self-taught programmer who has been obsessed with programming for the past 5 years. I make software for myself and, occasionally, for friends. Here you can find some of my projects that I worked on, from simple problem solutions to network applications and real-life scenarios!

### üß∞ Languages and Tools

These are the languages and tools I have been using the most. Almost all of my projects were done in Visual Studio.

   <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª About my coding jurney</h3></summary>
I was introduced to programming in middle school by my IT teacher, who taught us the basics of coding and logic. We started with Scratch and, within a year, moved on to C++, learning it from scratch. I did quite well in school, so my teacher invited me, along with a few classmates, to join an IT contest practice group where we worked on competition problems. However, I struggled with the complex syntax of C++ and the challenging questions. Despite trying my best, I decided to leave the group to focus more on my schoolwork and maintain my grades.

Over a year later, I decided to give C++ another try. I searched for it online, clicked the first link on cplusplus.com, and started getting familiar with the language again. This continued for some time, but I eventually got bored because I didn't have any project ideas, and coding wasn‚Äôt a priority compared to subjects like math and physics.

Another year later, I stumbled upon a video about malware development, which reignited my interest. I became fascinated with the idea of writing code that could lock down files and software behind a wall. At the time, I was just a curious kid who loved planning. By planning, I mean setting goals that had to be accomplished without my direct involvement, like building a rocket that I couldn‚Äôt control once launched. Malware operates on a similar principle, which made me fall in love with writing applications that work autonomously with minimal input or control. If I made a mistake, the program wouldn't work.

At 16, I wrote my first small application that blocked browsers like Chrome and Mozilla using batch script. I chose batch script because it was easy to learn, and there were plenty of tutorials available. Later, I wrote another application that blocked folders. This became something of an addiction for me. However, I soon realized that batch script didn‚Äôt give me enough control or flexibility to create more advanced applications, so I returned to C++.

I began by transferring my knowledge from batch script to C++, learning how to manipulate the registry, files, and so on. I decided to dive into networking early on, and though it was challenging, after two weeks of hard work, my first chat app compiled. It felt like I had overcome a huge obstacle.

As time went on, I learned multithreading and combined everything I had learned to build multithreaded servers capable of handling thousands of connections simultaneously. I felt great, like I knew everything‚Äîbut at the same time, I sensed that my knowledge was still lacking. So, I decided to explore what happens behind the scenes. That‚Äôs when I turned to Assembly language. I had heard it was difficult, but I found it simpler than C++ because of its straightforward syntax. After a month, I became comfortable writing Assembly code and learned a lot about hardware and CPUs. However, I didn‚Äôt need Assembly for my applications, aside from occasional optimization.

Eventually, I decided to take another step and learn driver development. As usual, I tried to integrate what I learned into my personal projects. I wrote a network driver that acted as a sort of firewall. I needed a way to stop antivirus applications from updating, so I found a vulnerability where a firewall controller could let filters block itself. This led me to become familiar with Windows Filtering Platform (WFP) and realize how little I knew about Windows networking.

Today, I continue working on my projects, making libraries and personal application while improving my code and adhering to best practices, following naming conventions and design patterns used in real-world applications. I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come, but I know there‚Äôs still MUCH more to learn.
  Thank you for reading to the end.
